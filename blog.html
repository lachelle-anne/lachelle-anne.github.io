            <p>| By Lachelle Pavlovic | Sept 04, 2021 |</p>
            <p>When starting out, gaining access to educational content and identifying resources appropriate to your
                level can often be tricky.</p>
            <p>The first links available when searching ‘learn to code’ are listings by larger companies offering
                fast-tracked courses, boot camps, classes and subscriptions. The internet is vast, and search algorithms
                will often bring up a more popular link based on rank rather than showing the least complex result.</p>
            <img class="blog-image long" src="./images/blog/google-search.jpg" />
            <p>So, where do you start?</p>
            <p>There are many different learning styles, but not all content caters for these. First, identifying your
                learning styles is critical in optimising your learning. This will enable you to build techniques to
                better engage and understand the information given, not only aiding you in your studies but equipping
                you with skills that can be utilised within your career.</p>
            <img class="blog-image square" src="./images/blog/learning-styles.jpeg" />
            <p>Instances of courses and video tutorials are easily accessible, but it can be challenging to
                source information relevant to your level. Starting with online code editors or interactive tutorial
                sections that allow you to work with the code gives a more hands-on approach. This will assist you in
                gaining a better understanding of what code is and how changes within it affect the result.</p>
            <p>One of the first recommendations I came across online when looking to start was to come up with a simple
                project and choose a programming language. This can definitely be a great incentive to begin learning
                and work on your own passion project, but not all will start with this direction. As you become more
                attuned to programming, you will find that some project ideas may be too complex to begin with or may
                have a more suitable language for that project type. In saying this, don't let this deter you from
                trying and researching different projects to start with!</p>
            <p>A search of the most popular programming languages or a language difficulty list is a great guide to
                commence learning. There are a few websites that provide an easy-to-follow introduction to a range of
                programming languages. At the end of this blog, I will list a few that I find insightful and regularly
                use for guidance.</p>
            <img class="blog-image square" src="./images/blog/programming-languages-2021.jpg" />
            <p>To encourage the most beneficial way of learning, start with a simple project that has been covered well
                and use your resources as a guide rather than following a video or tutorial. Not only will this assist
                you in better understanding the code, you will feel more achieved in knowing you figured it out -
                puzzles are your friends!</p>
            <p>A solution can be implemented in many different ways and refined as you learn more. Don’t let a challenge
                stop you from achieving knowledge.</p>
