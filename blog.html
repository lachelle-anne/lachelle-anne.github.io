            <p> Whether a beginner, student, graduate, junior or senior, gaining access to educational content and
                identifying resources appropriate to your level whilst also meeting your requirements can often be
                tricky, especially starting out. </p>
            <p> When browsing through any search engine, the first links available when searching ‘learn to
                code’ are listings by larger companies offering fast-tracked courses, boot-camps, classes and
                subscriptions. Before it is said, yes, trying a similar search for information on other industries like
                this will often obtain the same result. The internet is vast and searches can often be incoherent or
                imprecise due the phrasing or vagueness of your search. This can often be confronting and deterring as a
                beginner, and like most things takes time and patience to understand and define. </p>
            <p> So, where do you start? </p>
            <p> The first thing worth noting is that there are many different learning styles. Quite often we hear about
                them in passing, but not all content caters for multiple learning styles. Being able to first identify
                your learning style - or even styles - is key in optimising your learning. This will enable you to build
                techniques to better engage and understand the information given, not only aiding you for your studies,
                but equipping you with skills that can be utilised within your career. </p>
            <p> The next part can be a bit more challenging – sourcing information which is relevant to the level you
                are at. Instances of courses and video tutorials are easily accessible but can often be daunting, and if
                intended at a higher level audience, the experience can be disengaging and demotivate your enthusiasm to
                explore more into the subject. </p>
            <p>Starting out with resources that provide a basic hands-on approach such as online code editors and
                interactive tutorial sections, which allow you to work with and edit code, will assist you in gaining a
                better understanding of what code is and how changes within it affects the result.</p>
            <p>When I first began looking into programming, one of the first recommendations online mentioned to have a
                project in mind, and choose a programming language. This can definitely be great incentive to begin
                learning and work on your own passion project, but not all will start with this direction. As you become
                more attuned to programming, you will find that some ideas can be complex to start with, or may have
                another programming language more suitable for the project you have in mind – but don’t let this deter
                you from trying!</p>
            <p>When looking to start researching and learning a language, a guide which ranks them in order of
                difficulty or specifies easier languages to start with as a beginner is a great way to commence
                learning. There are a few websites worth mentioning which provide a great introduction to a range of
                programming languages and are easy to navigate and follow – I will list a few at the end of this blog
                entry which I find quite insightful and use regularly for guidance.
            <p>Starting with a simple project that has been covered well and using your resources as a guide rather than
                following a video or tutorial step-by-step will ultimately benefit your learning, encouraging your
                involvement and problem solving skills, rather than relying on mimicking or memorising the session.
                Not only does this help you understand the code, but you feel more achieved in knowing that you figured
                it out – puzzles are your friends!</p>
            <p>A solution can be implemented in many different ways and refined as you learn more. Don’t let a challenge
                stop you from achieving knowledge.</p>
